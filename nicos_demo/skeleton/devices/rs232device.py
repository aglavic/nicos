    Attention: this class does not serialize access to the serial port,

    This means: Do not poll these devices with the poller.

    To black-list a setup from polling, add its name to the "neverpoll"
    parameter of the Poller device in setups/special/poller.py.  To
    black-list a single device, add its name to the "blacklist" parameter
    of the Poller device.
