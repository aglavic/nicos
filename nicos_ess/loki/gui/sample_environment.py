    Base class for LoKI SANS sample environments. Each environment defined
    as a `namedtuple` with read-only properties. The settable properties of
    the environments should be fed in via corresponding Nicos devices.

    The read-only properties has a maximum length of five. This number
    optimized by the aesthetical considerations in the UI, though can be
    made different for each environment depending on the needs.

    The read-only properties should be hard-coded at the class level as a tuple.
    When adding a new environment, a type should be provided along with
    a dictionary with keys identical to that of defined in the property
    tuple of the corresponding environment. The type should be a string literal
    that is same as the environment name set in the environment
    object (`namedtuple`) declaration.
